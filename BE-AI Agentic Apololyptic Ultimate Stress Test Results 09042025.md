## Agentic Chaos Innovations

This test introduced four new categories of intelligent attack patterns designed to exploit potential weaknesses:

### 1. Intelligent Burst Attacks (`_agentic_burst_chaos`)
- **Purpose:** Overwhelm file system operations
- **Method:** Deep recursive directory scans with wildcard patterns
- **Target:** `fs_list` with recursive=True, pattern="**/*"
- **Impact:** Forces maximum I/O load and memory consumption

### 2. Tool Chain Chaos (`_agentic_tool_chain_chaos`) 
- **Purpose:** Test complex multi-tool dependency handling
- **Method:** Chains of interdependent operations
- **Tools:** shell_exec → fs_read → git_log sequences
- **Impact:** Tests async coordination and resource management

### 3. Memory Bomb Chaos (`_agentic_memory_bomb_chaos`)
- **Purpose:** Exhaust server memory resources
- **Method:** 150KB payloads with unique file writes
- **Payload:** "🧠MEMORY_BOMB🧠" × 10,000 characters
- **Impact:** Tests memory allocation limits and garbage collection

### 4. Recursive Operations Chaos (`_agentic_recursive_chaos`)
- **Purpose:** CPU exhaustion through complex operations
- **Method:** Intensive find, grep, and directory traversal commands
- **Examples:** `find ... -exec wc -l`, `grep -r 'async def'`, `du -sh`
- **Impact:** Tests CPU load handling and process management
