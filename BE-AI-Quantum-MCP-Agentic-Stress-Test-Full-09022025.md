## Critical Fixes and Improvements

### Root Cause Resolution
**Previous Issue**: System freezes during extreme test initialization
**Root Cause**: Blocking I/O operations in async logging system
**Solution**: Comprehensive async compatibility fixes

### Implemented Fixes

#### 1. Async Logging System (task_logger.py)
```python
# Before: Blocking psutil calls
memory = psutil.virtual_memory().used / 1024 / 1024

# After: Non-blocking with thread pool
memory = await loop.run_in_executor(None, lambda: psutil.virtual_memory().used / 1024 / 1024)
```

#### 2. Thread Pool Execution for Logging
```python
# Before: Blocking logging operations
self.task_logger.info(log_data)

# After: Non-blocking with thread pool
await loop.run_in_executor(None, self.task_logger.info, log_data)
```

#### 3. Singleton Management Improvements
- Added proper watchdog restart logic
- Implemented smart memory manager cleanup
- Fixed multiple initialization events
