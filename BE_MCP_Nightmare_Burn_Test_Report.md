## Test Methodology

The nightmare burn test consisted of 5 progressive phases designed to incrementally stress the server:

### Phase 1: Warmup Test
- **Purpose**: Prepare server for extreme load
- **Configuration**: 10 sequential requests
- **Result**: 100% success rate

### Phase 2: Extreme MCP Assault
- **Purpose**: Sustained high-intensity assault on MCP endpoints
- **Configuration**: 60 concurrent workers for 45 seconds
- **Request Types**: Mixed GET/POST MCP requests, initialize, tools/list
- **Result**: 23,953 requests, 532.3 req/s, 100% success

### Phase 3: Protocol Chaos Test
- **Purpose**: Test MCP protocol compliance with malformed requests
- **Configuration**: 750 rapid-fire requests including invalid JSON-RPC
- **Result**: 48.3% success (expected due to intentional malformed requests)

### Phase 4: Concurrent Bombardment
- **Purpose**: Simultaneous stress across all endpoints
- **Configuration**: 50 workers, 150 requests each (7,500 total)
- **Endpoints**: All major endpoints (MCP, health, metrics, admin, docs)
- **Result**: 100% success rate

### Phase 5: Sustained Pressure Test
- **Purpose**: Extended load with gradually increasing concurrency
- **Configuration**: 3 minutes, 12 intervals, 25-58 concurrent workers
- **Result**: 108,486 requests, 100% success rate
